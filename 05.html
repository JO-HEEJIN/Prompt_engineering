        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>The Chain of Thought Pattern is a prompting technique that enhances AI model's reasoning capabilities through a step-by-step breakdown of complex problems, leading to more accurate and understandable solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The Chain of Thought (CoT) pattern is a remarkable illustration of how human cognitive processes can be mirrored within artificial intelligence frameworks to enhance reasoning capabilities. Its essence lies in a sequential progression of thoughts, much akin to a cascade, where one idea seamlessly triggers the next.</p>
        
        <p>When transposed to the domain of large language models (LLMs), the CoT pattern unfurls its potential in significantly enhancing their reasoning faculties. By meticulously decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate, more manageable steps, it provides a structured pathway for the model to navigate through intricacies of the problem at hand.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, the alignment of the CoT pattern with human cognitive processes—often termed as human alignment—heralds a new era of understanding and trust between the model and users.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Also Known As</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Step-by-Step Reasoning</li>
            <li>Multi-Step Reasoning</li>
            <li>Slow Thinking</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Applicability</h2>
        <p>The Chain of Thought (CoT) pattern has broad applicability across a range of scenarios where complex reasoning is required:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Arithmetic Reasoning:</strong> Problems requiring series of calculations</li>
            <li><strong>Commonsense Reasoning:</strong> Tasks involving understanding and applying world knowledge</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolic Reasoning:</strong> Manipulating symbols according to logical rules</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-Shot Learning:</strong> Handling tasks without prior specific training</li>
            <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> Providing transparent reasoning processes</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Initial presentation of the problem</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Prompt:</strong> Signaling the start of reasoning process</li>
            <li><strong>Intermediate Reasoning Steps:</strong> Step-by-step breakdown of solution</li>
            <li><strong>Final Solution:</strong> Culmination of reasoning steps</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Clarification:</strong> Additional explanation if needed</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Three CoT prompt templates have been crafted:</p>
        <pre>
Template 1:
The problem is [problem description].
Let's think step by step.

Template 2:
The problem is [problem description].
Let's solve this problem step by step.

Template 3:
The problem is [problem description].
Let's solve this problem step by step.
First, we need to identify the subtasks.</pre>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Logical Reasoning Problem</h3>
            <p><strong>Prompt (Using Template-1):</strong></p>
            <p>"I have two boxes, one contains apples and the other contains oranges. I can only open one box. I need to find the box with the apples. What should I do? Let's think step by step."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Arithmetic Problem</h3>
            <p><strong>Prompt (Using Template-2):</strong></p>
            <p>"A user wants to plan a road trip and needs to calculate the total cost based on distance, fuel efficiency, and cost of accommodation..."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The essence of the Chain of Thought (CoT) pattern resonates with the principles elucidated in Daniel Kahneman's seminal book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow". The CoT pattern mirrors the attributes of System 2, advocating a slower, step-by-step analytical reasoning process to traverse through complex problems.</p>
        
        <h3>Unveiling Zero-Shot Reasoning Capabilities</h3>
        <p>A simple, insightful prompt, "Let's think step by step" can significantly bolster performance of LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.</p>
        
        <h3>Emergent Benefits with Model Scale</h3>
        <p>The efficacy of CoT prompting amplifies with the model's size—it only starts showing promise with models having around 100 billion parameters or more.</p>
